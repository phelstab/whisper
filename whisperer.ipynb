      "0.00 - 2.32:  how Nord Stream was done.\n",
      "2.32 - 4.88:  I'm going to show you things you haven't seen before,\n",
      "4.88 - 7.84:  and I'm going to give you definitive evidence\n",
      "7.84 - 10.56:  so that you know that the United States\n",
      "10.56 - 14.60:  was behind the Nord Stream pipeline sabotages.\n",
      "14.60 - 16.08:  So I'm going to lay everything out,\n",
      "16.08 - 18.76:  but stay with me and I'll get you there.\n",
      "18.76 - 20.00:  All right, here we go.\n",
      "20.00 - 22.88:  I'm not supporting this with measures.\n",
      "22.88 - 25.44:  Let me answer the first question for us.\n",
      "25.44 - 28.56:  If Germany, if Russian Vades,\n",
      "28.56 - 35.56:  that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again,\n",
      "35.56 - 41.20:  then there will be no longer a Nord Stream too.\n",
      "41.20 - 42.48:  We will bring it into it.\n",
      "45.32 - 52.00:  How will you do that exactly since the project\n",
      "52.00 - 55.68:  and control of the project is within Germany's control?\n",
      "55.68 - 58.84:  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.\n",
      "62.04 - 63.92:  Should thank you for your fire.\n",
      "63.92 - 67.00:  You know, as I was smug look on his face and that smile,\n",
      "67.00 - 69.32:  now he knows exactly what he's talking about, right?\n",
      "69.32 - 72.28:  But we can't say, you know, people can't say in plain English\n",
      "72.28 - 73.72:  what we're talking about.\n",
      "73.72 - 76.20:  Okay, but a lot of our government officials,\n",
      "76.20 - 78.08:  we've already discussed this that we wanted\n",
      "78.08 - 79.80:  and this Nord Stream pipeline.\n",
      "79.80 - 82.12:  There's dozens and dozens and dozens of videos.\n",
      "82.12 - 84.72:  I'll just play you one real quick from here to there,\n",
      "84.84 - 87.76:  but everything is on the table, I would say,\n",
      "87.76 - 89.80:  if that is helpful.\n",
      "89.80 - 93.32:  One thing that I believe, certainly the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\n",
      "93.32 - 96.40:  is pretty unified on, it may not be unanimous,\n",
      "96.40 - 101.12:  was our support for sanctions against Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n",
      "101.12 - 104.60:  I think we were all, many of us were very disappointed\n",
      "104.60 - 107.56:  that those sanctions were not fully implemented\n",
      "107.56 - 109.36:  and the construction continued.\n",
      "110.36 - 116.36:  I can't think of a more powerful way to punish Russian aggression\n",
      "116.36 - 119.12:  than by rolling back what progress has been made\n",
      "119.12 - 123.24:  and if it all possible, prevent the Nord Stream 2\n",
      "123.24 - 125.60:  from ever being completed.\n",
      "125.60 - 128.48:  Is that something that is being discussed with allies?\n",
      "128.48 - 131.28:  Is that something that's being contemplated?\n",
      "131.28 - 132.20:  Absolutely.\n",
      "132.20 - 135.88:  And as you recall from the July US German statement\n",
      "135.92 - 139.68:  that was very much in that statement\n",
      "139.68 - 144.04:  that if that any moves Russian aggression against Ukraine\n",
      "144.04 - 146.80:  would have a direct impact on the pipeline\n",
      "146.80 - 149.92:  and that is our expectation and the conversation\n",
      "149.92 - 151.40:  that we're having.\n",
      "151.40 - 153.12:  So again, direct impact is one thing,\n",
      "153.12 - 156.04:  but I'm literally talking about rolling back\n",
      "157.52 - 160.92:  the pipeline, loosely to find that,\n",
      "160.92 - 164.24:  but I mean, taking action that will prevent it\n",
      "164.24 - 167.32:  from ever becoming operational.\n",
      "167.32 - 170.40:  I think if President Putin moves on Ukraine,\n",
      "170.40 - 174.28:  our expectation is that the pipeline will be suspended.\n",
      "175.84 - 179.00:  Well, I certainly hope that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\n",
      "179.00 - 184.00:  would take up legislation to go beyond just suspending it,\n",
      "184.16 - 186.08:  but from ending it permanently.\n",
      "186.08 - 188.16:  But anyway, thank you, Secretary Newell.\n",
      "189.16 - 191.88:  They're talking about ending it permanently.\n",
      "191.88 - 196.48:  Our government officials have talked about destroying it,\n",
      "196.48 - 199.32:  blowing it up without actually saying those words,\n",
      "199.32 - 202.60:  but we're everybody's very clear on what we want.\n",
      "202.60 - 204.44:  We have the motive that we want to take this\n",
      "204.44 - 205.68:  in our extreme pipeline out.\n",
      "207.60 - 209.40:  So the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline,\n",
      "209.40 - 211.52:  the natural gas pipeline that carried,\n",
      "211.52 - 214.48:  well, natural gas from East to West Europe\n",
      "214.48 - 217.96:  was the single most profound active environmental terrorism\n",
      "217.96 - 219.00:  in history.\n",
      "219.00 - 221.64:  It released more deadly CO2 into the atmosphere.\n",
      "221.64 - 225.28:  It was also an attack on our NATO allies.\n",
      "225.28 - 227.00:  Our NATO allies were the beneficiaries\n",
      "227.00 - 228.68:  of the natural gas pipeline Germany,\n",
      "228.68 - 231.80:  which is the core of European NATO suffered.\n",
      "231.80 - 233.04:  So the Biden administration was talking about\n",
      "233.04 - 235.68:  how much it loves NATO, attack NATO, and they did it.\n",
      "235.68 - 237.68:  They promised to carry it out.\n",
      "237.68 - 239.56:  They haven't really denied that they did it.\n",
      "239.56 - 241.24:  So during interview with Donald Trump yesterday,\n",
      "241.24 - 243.80:  we thought we'd ask, who does he think did it?\n",
      "243.80 - 245.52:  We previewed the answer last night.\n",
      "245.52 - 246.80:  Here's the full exchange.\n",
      "248.24 - 250.28:  Who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline?\n",
      "252.36 - 254.40:  I don't want to get our country in trouble,\n",
      "254.40 - 256.00:  so I won't answer it.\n",
      "256.00 - 260.40:  But I can tell you who it wasn't was Russia.\n",
      "260.40 - 262.00:  How about when they blamed Russia?\n",
      "262.00 - 264.84:  They said Russia blew up their own pipeline.\n",
      "264.84 - 267.04:  You got a kick out of that one, too.\n",
      "267.04 - 268.04:  It wasn't Russia.\n",
      "269.84 - 271.40:  So I won't answer the question,\n",
      "271.40 - 273.44:  because I don't want to get our country\n",
      "273.44 - 276.16:  any deeper than they already are.\n",
      "276.16 - 277.96:  But it sort of all starts.\n",
      "277.96 - 280.32:  We have the most...\n",
      "280.40 - 283.40:  Okay, so now we have the current president\n",
      "283.40 - 285.04:  saying they're going to end Nord Stream.\n",
      "285.04 - 287.04:  We have our government officials saying they're going to end\n",
      "287.04 - 288.04:  Nord Stream.\n",
      "288.04 - 291.32:  And we also have the previous president, Donald Trump,\n",
      "291.32 - 293.08:  saying, oh, I don't want to say who did it,\n",
      "293.08 - 294.44:  but it certainly wasn't Russia.\n",
      "294.44 - 296.24:  And I don't want to get us in trouble.\n",
      "296.24 - 299.12:  So everything is alluding to the United States\n",
      "299.12 - 300.76:  blowing this pipeline up.\n",
      "300.76 - 305.44:  Okay, so you know, just add one more kicker.\n",
      "305.44 - 309.76:  We had a red Xikorsky, if you can see this.\n",
      "309.80 - 314.00:  The right after blowing up the pipeline, he tweeted out,\n",
      "314.00 - 315.04:  thank you, USA.\n",
      "315.04 - 317.36:  And then later deleted this.\n",
      "317.36 - 322.12:  Okay, but okay, so now we just have some circumstantial evidence.\n",
      "322.12 - 325.64:  Okay, let's get into the really meeting bones\n",
      "325.64 - 329.80:  of everything going on here and how this took place.\n",
      "329.80 - 333.20:  So, what...\n",
      "333.20 - 336.56:  How this originally occurred, how this started.\n",
      "336.56 - 338.52:  Well, there's a long story about Biden.\n",
      "338.52 - 341.32:  They wanted to do it and Biden talked with security officials\n",
      "341.32 - 343.80:  and everything and the intelligence community.\n",
      "343.80 - 346.12:  But they used this bolt ops 22\n",
      "347.92 - 350.24:  to actually plant the explosives.\n",
      "350.24 - 354.96:  Okay, so this bolt ops 22\n",
      "354.96 - 359.60:  is a premier maritime focus exercise in the Baltic region.\n",
      "359.60 - 363.96:  It took place between June 5th to June 17th.\n",
      "365.60 - 368.44:  And here's the website, the press release all about it.\n",
      "369.08 - 372.92:  The participating nations were Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark,\n",
      "372.92 - 377.92:  Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania,\n",
      "378.64 - 383.20:  the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey,\n",
      "383.20 - 386.56:  the United Kingdom and the United States.\n",
      "386.56 - 391.56:  Okay, and they were doing all sorts of things underwater.\n",
      "392.92 - 394.76:  But you know, one of the notable things here is saying,\n",
      "394.76 - 397.48:  scientists from five nations brought the latest advancements\n",
      "397.48 - 400.40:  and unmanned underwater vehicle,\n",
      "400.40 - 402.76:  mine hunting technology to the Baltic Sea\n",
      "402.76 - 404.88:  to demonstrate the vehicles effectiveness\n",
      "404.88 - 406.80:  in operational scenarios.\n",
      "406.80 - 409.56:  The bolt ops mine countermeasure task group\n",
      "409.56 - 411.36:  ventured throughout the Baltic region,\n",
      "411.36 - 414.72:  practicing ordinance location, exploitation\n",
      "414.72 - 418.80:  and disarming in critical maritime choke points.\n",
      "419.88 - 424.88:  Okay, so they were around the Baltic region\n",
      "425.60 - 428.24:  and the bolt ops 22 was a perfect cover\n",
      "428.24 - 430.88:  to plant these explosives.\n",
      "430.88 - 433.52:  Now there is a lot of speculation\n",
      "433.52 - 435.92:  over how these explosives were planted.\n",
      "435.92 - 440.12:  Now we know that they used navy divers, okay?\n",
      "440.12 - 442.08:  And the Navy seals have several vehicles\n",
      "442.08 - 445.32:  that can get them from point A to B underwater.\n",
      "445.32 - 447.48:  Now some people have speculated\n",
      "447.48 - 450.56:  that the dry combat submersible was used\n",
      "450.56 - 454.20:  to plant these explosives on the pipelines.\n",
      "455.24 - 458.40:  But in my personal opinion,\n",
      "458.40 - 461.60:  I do not believe that dry combat submersible was used\n",
      "461.60 - 464.92:  because it was estimated by experts\n",
      "464.92 - 469.12:  that each of the explosions were 500 kilograms of peace.\n",
      "469.12 - 473.64:  And if one submersible mini-sub\n",
      "473.64 - 475.28:  were to go around and plant all those,\n",
      "475.28 - 477.08:  it would take multiple, multiple missions\n",
      "477.08 - 479.08:  with a dry combat submersible.\n",
      "479.08 - 481.16:  Now there is another vehicle\n",
      "481.16 - 483.32:  called the Advanced Seal Delivery System.\n",
      "483.52 - 487.36:  Now this is the biggest mini-sub that's publicly known\n",
      "487.36 - 489.76:  that the Navy seals have access to.\n",
      "489.76 - 493.68:  And this would be able to not only,\n",
      "495.16 - 497.24:  it would be able to carry all that weight,\n",
      "497.24 - 499.56:  it would be able to carry 2,000 kilograms\n",
      "499.56 - 502.96:  worth of explosives that's 500 kilograms times four.\n",
      "504.32 - 506.84:  And also it's able to get down to the depths\n",
      "506.84 - 508.32:  that you need to get down to.\n",
      "508.32 - 510.56:  The pipeline explosions,\n",
      "510.56 - 514.80:  they happened between 230 feet and 295 feet.\n",
      "515.80 - 519.04:  And it's questionable whether the dry combat submersible\n",
      "519.04 - 522.64:  because of the lockout that they do with divers,\n",
      "522.64 - 525.20:  that takes place at about 95 feet.\n",
      "525.20 - 528.00:  So the dry combat submersible might not have been capable\n",
      "528.00 - 529.80:  of pulling this off.\n",
      "529.80 - 531.12:  The Advanced Seal Delivery System,\n",
      "531.12 - 533.88:  while older was capable of pulling this off.\n",
      "535.08 - 539.52:  The dry combat submersible was also brand new\n",
      "539.52 - 541.16:  and just been delivered.\n",
      "541.16 - 543.24:  So they don't even have much training on this at all.\n",
      "543.24 - 545.40:  Versus the Advanced Seal Delivery System,\n",
      "545.40 - 546.80:  it was a tried and true method.\n",
      "546.80 - 551.24:  It has a simulator, it's been used for scenarios\n",
      "551.24 - 552.32:  of blowing up pipelines.\n",
      "552.32 - 554.96:  There's training missions for blowing up pipelines.\n",
      "554.96 - 556.32:  It can be done.\n",
      "556.32 - 559.44:  Okay, so now we're really gonna get into it.\n",
      "560.60 - 563.60:  Okay, so this is public data.\n",
      "563.60 - 565.20:  What I'm about to show you,\n",
      "565.20 - 567.40:  this is where it really gets intense.\n",
      "567.40 - 571.04:  Okay, this is flight radar 24.\n",
      "571.04 - 573.96:  Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring it back.\n",
      "573.96 - 578.46:  I'm gonna bring it back to the date of September 26th.\n",
      "579.96 - 583.04:  Okay, September 26th.\n",
      "583.04 - 584.68:  I'm gonna start this playback.\n",
      "588.36 - 591.20:  Okay, here we are, September 26th.\n",
      "591.20 - 594.64:  So just starting off, just so you know,\n",
      "594.64 - 599.64:  here's a little map of where we're looking at here.\n",
      "600.00 - 603.76:  The pipeline, the first explosion happened around here\n",
      "603.76 - 605.68:  and the next three happened up here.\n",
      "607.32 - 611.40:  This took place at about,\n",
      "611.40 - 613.80:  this is in UTC time down here.\n",
      "613.80 - 618.24:  The first explosion took place at 12.03 AM.\n",
      "618.24 - 622.36:  Okay, so let me go back.\n",
      "623.36 - 624.36:  It says a set.\n",
      "624.36 - 627.20:  If you bring these, if you overlay this,\n",
      "627.20 - 629.52:  you can see the first point is here\n",
      "629.52 - 631.60:  and the next ones would be about up here.\n",
      "631.60 - 634.40:  But this one down here, explode at 12.03.\n",
      "635.92 - 640.92:  All right, so the one, let's actually go a couple hours back.\n",
      "644.00 - 646.64:  And let's actually bring it back to,\n",
      "647.64 - 649.68:  I will bring it the time,\n",
      "652.36 - 657.36:  back to 2245, all the way to here.\n",
      "665.20 - 667.76:  Now look at this, right here.\n",
      "667.76 - 670.88:  This is before the first explosion.\n",
      "670.88 - 672.68:  Keep in mind the first explosion happened\n",
      "672.68 - 674.56:  about right here in the timeline.\n",
      "674.56 - 677.84:  Now we have a helicopter that is loitering.\n",
      "677.84 - 679.52:  Now what is this helicopter?\n",
      "679.52 - 680.96:  Let me click on this again.\n",
      "681.00 - 682.40:  It's gonna load it.\n",
      "682.40 - 686.92:  This helicopter has been loitering here for a long time.\n",
      "686.92 - 690.92:  Now this is the path that it's already done.\n",
      "690.92 - 693.04:  Unfortunately, when I go back to the timeline,\n",
      "693.04 - 696.16:  it doesn't show, it go through this,\n",
      "696.16 - 698.64:  but it has the history of this flight path.\n",
      "698.64 - 701.76:  So this helicopter has been loitering.\n",
      "701.76 - 704.12:  Now what is this helicopter?\n",
      "704.12 - 707.92:  It is a Sikorsky MH60RC halt.\n",
      "707.92 - 709.92:  Okay, now let me pull that up for you\n",
      "709.92 - 711.24:  and show you what that is.\n",
      "714.24 - 717.56:  The MH60C Hawk is a multi-mission helicopter operated\n",
      "717.56 - 721.16:  by the US Navy and also known as Romeo.\n",
      "721.16 - 724.52:  It's the most capable naval helicopter available today,\n",

      "780.28 - 781.96:  was taken out of service.\n",

      "788.84 - 793.24:  Okay, so that's the important information that you need to know.\n",
      "793.24 - 796.08:  So that's the type of helicopter that's being used.\n",
      "796.08 - 799.68:  Now one thing that was mentioned was sona buoys.\n",
      "799.68 - 802.24:  Sona buoys are what actually triggers\n",
      "802.24 - 804.76:  the explosions once they've been in place.\n",
      "804.76 - 808.44:  The sona buoys, as a sensing acoustic signal\n",
      "808.44 - 813.44:  through the water and it reaches the explosives\n",
      "814.56 - 816.28:  and then it has a timer on there.\n",
      "816.28 - 818.12:  A certain timer, a certain amount of hours\n",
      "818.12 - 819.92:  that it's gonna go off.\n",

      "823.16 - 825.48:  has been loitering here for a long, long time.\n",
      "826.32 - 829.68:  Okay, and it just keeps circling back here.\n",
      "829.68 - 834.20:  Okay, now it is capable of detonating this pipeline\n",
      "834.20 - 836.00:  with the sona buoys.\n",
      "836.00 - 841.00:  This helicopter, it is capable of setting those explosives off.\n",

      "845.36 - 848.44:  I'm gonna go all the way to when the pipeline is blown up.\n",
      "849.44 - 855.44:  Okay, by now there's an explosion in the water here.\n",
      "855.44 - 859.44:  Okay, let me click on this.\n",
      "859.44 - 864.44:  It's still loitering around, around more time.\n",
      "867.44 - 871.44:  It may fast forward a little more.\n",
      "871.44 - 874.44:  I might look at the time.\n",
      "875.44 - 878.44:  Long time.\n",
      "878.44 - 883.44:  In fact, click on here.\n",
      "883.44 - 888.44:  Now it has perfect visibility of,\n",
      "888.44 - 890.44:  but you know, it potentially has visibility\n",
      "890.44 - 893.44:  as well of the pipeline, but we're gonna cover that more\n",
      "893.44 - 894.44:  and a little bit.\n",
      "894.44 - 896.44:  You're gonna see how crazy this gets.\n",
      "896.44 - 900.44:  So this helicopter is gonna loiter all the way\n",
      "901.44 - 907.44:  until about 130,\n",
      "907.44 - 912.44:  130, too.\n",

      "930.44 - 936.44:  This is 135 in the morning.\n",
      "936.44 - 945.44:  And I believe that we're gonna lose contact with it very shortly.\n",
      "945.44 - 946.44:  Yep.\n",
      "946.44 - 948.44:  And it just goes off the map.\n",

      "962.44 - 964.44:  Okay.\n",
      "964.44 - 971.44:  I think that's where I lose it.\n",
      "971.44 - 973.44:  Yeah, right about there.\n",
      "973.44 - 975.44:  We have no more data for that.\n",
      "975.44 - 978.44:  Okay, so in reality,\n",
      "978.44 - 980.44:  that helicopter,\n",
      "980.44 - 985.44:  that US Navy helicopter with son of a buoys designed for submarine warfare,\n",
      "985.44 - 990.44:  it loitered for three hours for three hours here.\n",
      "990.44 - 991.44:  Okay.\n",
      "991.44 - 993.44:  But that's not,\n",
      "993.44 - 998.44:  and this is during the time of the first explosion.\n",
      "998.44 - 1000.44:  Okay, so speculation,\n",
      "1000.44 - 1005.44:  but it dropped a son of a bully that set off this explosion.\n",
      "1005.44 - 1006.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1006.44 - 1008.44:  Now,\n",
      "1008.44 - 1014.44:  we're gonna now check out something that is.\n",
      "1014.44 - 1016.44:  Really crazy.\n",
      "1016.44 - 1017.44:  It's not just the,\n",
      "1017.44 - 1019.44:  not just the coincidence.\n",
      "1019.44 - 1024.44:  So now we're gonna bring it back to.\n",
      "1024.44 - 1030.44:  2328.\n",
      "1030.44 - 1040.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1040.44 - 1043.44:  Let's make it a little easier.\n",
      "1043.44 - 1053.44:  Keep in mind the first explosions about right here.\n",
      "1053.44 - 1054.44:  Bear with me.\n",
      "1073.44 - 1076.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1076.44 - 1083.44:  Oops.\n",
      "1083.44 - 1093.44:  All right.\n",
      "1093.44 - 1094.44:  It's makes easier.\n",
      "1094.44 - 1099.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1099.44 - 1105.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1105.44 - 1108.44:  Here we go.\n",
      "1108.44 - 1111.44:  Now we have this no call sign plane.\n",
      "1111.44 - 1112.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1112.44 - 1115.44:  Meaning we don't really don't know who this is.\n",
      "1115.44 - 1117.44:  Okay, let's follow this guy back.\n",
      "1117.44 - 1119.44:  Okay, here he is.\n",
      "1119.44 - 1120.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1120.44 - 1122.44:  So here's this no call sign coming in.\n",
      "1122.44 - 1125.44:  Now, keep in mind the first explosion happened right here.\n",
      "1125.44 - 1127.44:  Now this plane.\n",
      "1127.44 - 1128.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1128.44 - 1130.44:  Well, let's see.\n",
      "1130.44 - 1133.44:  The only, the data we have on it.\n",
      "1133.44 - 1135.44:  Is it came out of nowhere.\n",
      "1135.44 - 1137.44:  So I don't somehow.\n",
      "1137.44 - 1139.44:  It must have been on a ship or something.\n",
      "1139.44 - 1140.44:  I don't, I don't know.\n",
      "1140.44 - 1141.44:  This is all data we have.\n",
      "1141.44 - 1149.44:  Whoops.\n",
      "1149.44 - 1154.44:  Okay. Now, let me stop this.\n",
      "1154.44 - 1156.44:  All right.\n",
      "1156.44 - 1162.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1162.44 - 1166.44:  Let me show you what this is.\n",
      "1166.44 - 1167.44:  It has the.\n",
      "1167.44 - 1168.44:  It's loading.\n",
      "1168.44 - 1170.44:  I'm sorry, it's a little bit slow.\n",
      "1170.44 - 1171.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1171.44 - 1173.44:  So this is.\n",
      "1173.44 - 1175.44:  Keep in mind there's no call sign.\n",
      "1175.44 - 1176.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1176.44 - 1178.44:  We really don't know who this is.\n",
      "1178.44 - 1181.44:  They came out of the middle of the water.\n",
      "1181.44 - 1182.44:  They were launched.\n",
      "1182.44 - 1183.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1183.44 - 1185.44:  I don't know where that came from.\n",
      "1185.44 - 1186.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1186.44 - 1194.44:  Let's pause it.\n",
      "1194.44 - 1200.44:  Sorry for the loading.\n",
      "1200.44 - 1203.44:  Now keep in mind this.\n",
      "1203.44 - 1206.44:  This is a Boeing P8.\n",
      "1206.44 - 1207.44:  A.\n",
      "1207.44 - 1208.44:  Okay. Here we go.\n",
      "1208.44 - 1209.44:  It's paused.\n",
      "1209.44 - 1211.44:  This is a Boeing P8A.\n",
      "1211.44 - 1212.44:  Poseidon.\n",
      "1212.44 - 1213.44:  Okay.\n",
      "1213.44 - 1214.44:  Now what is that?\n",
      "1214.44 - 1216.44:  Let me show you what that is.\n",
      "1216.44 - 1220.44:  As we get to the back here, you can see cut out here is the weapons bay.\n",
      "1220.44 - 1222.44:  We have the ability to carry torpedoes as well.\n",
      "1222.44 - 1227.44:  The primary mission of the P8 is anti-submarine warfare.\n",
      "1227.44 - 1234.00:  So the idea is this aircraft can go out cold water, search for an aircraft, refine that position,\n",
      "1234.00 - 1238.00:  and then complete the kill chain with a torpedo if necessary.\n",
      "1238.00 - 1240.84:  You can even see behind the weapons bay here.\n",
      "1240.84 - 1241.84:  You have these openings.\n",
      "1241.84 - 1242.84:  These are the sonoboe.\n",
      "1242.84 - 1245.60:  The exits for the sonoboe launchers.\n",
      "1245.60 - 1250.36:  So launching sonoboe is our main way of prosecuting submarines.\n",
      "1250.36 - 1251.36:  Use acoustically.\n",
      "1251.36 - 1257.72:  We're basically just launching large microphones into the water to try and listen for the submarines\n",
      "1257.72 - 1260.28:  or maybe actively acquire them.\n",
      "1260.28 - 1267.68:  And we have the ability to launch many, many, many sonoboe's and stay on station tracking\n",
      "1267.68 - 1271.00:  someone if necessary for long periods of time as well.\n",
      "1271.00 - 1272.00:  Hi.\n",
      "1273.00 - 1279.60:  OK, so what he's telling you is the first of all, this is a US Nate.\n",
      "1279.60 - 1284.20:  Once again, this is another US Navy vehicle.\n",
      "1284.20 - 1289.60:  OK, I wish I could pause this.\n",
      "1289.60 - 1291.40:  OK, it's paused.\n",
      "1291.40 - 1293.00:  This is another US Navy vehicle.\n",
      "1293.00 - 1298.80:  It's a resounding reconnaissance aircraft is anti-submarine warfare, anti surface warfare.\n",
      "1298.80 - 1300.20:  It's a submarine killer.\n",
      "1300.20 - 1302.80:  Now, it can drop all these sonoboe's.\n",
      "1302.80 - 1311.44:  So just like the, just like this, a Cikorsky MH60R, it also can detonate underwater explosives\n",
      "1311.44 - 1313.40:  with the sonoboe's.\n",
      "1313.40 - 1319.48:  Now, the interesting thing is that keep in mind that this first explosion that happened\n",
      "1319.48 - 1326.36:  right here, that took place at 12 o'3 am about here in the timeline.\n",
      "1326.36 - 1335.36:  This, this Boeing P88 Poseidon, it took off before the explosion even happened.\n",
      "1335.36 - 1341.08:  OK, so it's not like it was going at it, it heard, oh, there's been explosion going\n",
      "1341.08 - 1344.12:  to investigate it took off before that even happened.\n",
      "1344.12 - 1355.92:  OK, so also you will notice that it is going right by the explosion site right here.\n",
      "1355.92 - 1360.24:  OK, the pipeline has already exploded now in this timeline.\n",
      "1360.24 - 1368.16:  And within about within a little more than one hour, it is already flying over exactly\n",
      "1368.16 - 1370.24:  where it occurred.\n",
      "1370.24 - 1375.72:  No doubt the United States is making taking reconnaissance and making sure that that pipeline has blown\n",
      "1375.72 - 1380.16:  up when they thought it's going to blow up.\n",
      "1380.16 - 1382.24:  That's going to get even crazier.\n",
      "1383.08 - 1389.24:  OK, as I said, once again, very sketchy has no call sign.\n",
      "1389.24 - 1396.00:  Now, keep in mind that helicopter, still loitering over there that I showed you in the beginning.\n",
      "1396.00 - 1398.48:  Now, what's this?\n",
      "1398.48 - 1402.28:  This is a third aircraft.\n",
      "1402.28 - 1406.32:  This is a Boeing KC-130R Strato tanker.\n",
      "1406.32 - 1414.20:  So what this is, this is it, this is a refueling plane.\n",
      "1414.20 - 1416.92:  This is a refueling plane for this Poseidon.\n",
      "1416.92 - 1424.44:  So what they're going to do now is they're going to link up and this guy is going to refuel\n",
      "1424.44 - 1426.56:  this Poseidon.\n",
      "1426.56 - 1431.68:  So now they're going to dance with each other.\n",
      "1431.68 - 1432.68:  And I'll speed that up.\n",
      "1432.68 - 1435.88:  Now you can see both of them are by each other.\n",
      "1435.88 - 1445.32:  They're hugging each other and they're going to do loops and loops and loops.\n",
      "1445.32 - 1454.68:  No call sign with that Strato tanker getting the refueled looping around looping around loop\n",
      "1454.68 - 1457.72:  around.\n",
      "1457.72 - 1462.56:  Do you really believe it is quencinets is flying right over where it blew up, rated the exact\n",
      "1462.56 - 1466.40:  time?\n",
      "1466.40 - 1470.72:  They wanted to make sure the explosives, they wanted to make sure that they could see what\n",
      "1470.72 - 1473.08:  had happened when they had done it.\n",
      "1473.08 - 1474.56:  This is US Navy.\n",
      "1474.56 - 1479.98:  As you can see by now that helicopter has gone, helicopters gone, but we still have our\n",
      "1479.98 - 1483.04:  Poseidon here for reconnaissance.\n",
      "1483.04 - 1486.36:  It's going to fly around more.\n",
      "1486.36 - 1489.16:  Let's speed this up.\n",
      "1489.16 - 1491.68:  They're still hugging each other.\n",
      "1491.68 - 1496.00:  This is the Strato tanker doing its laps.\n",
      "1496.00 - 1497.00:  Oops.\n",
